# Rosetta Bitcoin Tutorial

A small React Bitcoin Wallet for Rosetta tutorial purposes.

Inside of `src/WalletView.tsx`, enter your Lunar API key, which you can get from [lunar.dev](https://lunar.dev).
If you're running your own Rosetta Bitcoin Node, you can instead use that like `new RosettaClient({baseUrl: '<YOUR_ROSETTA_NODE_URL>'})`.

Run `yarn start` in your terminal. This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
