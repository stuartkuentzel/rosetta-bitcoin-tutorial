# Rosetta Bitcoin Tutorial

A small React Bitcoin Wallet for Rosetta tutorial purposes.

Inside of `.env` file at the root of the project, enter your Lunar API key, which you can get from [lunar.dev](https://lunar.dev).
If you're running your own Rosetta Bitcoin Node, you can instead use that by replacing the value of `REACT_APP_ROSETTA_URL` with the url to your own node.

Run `yarn start` in your terminal. This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
